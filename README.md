# Dynamic Sidebar

This is an React App that showcases how to use React Router to create dynamic content based on the users current location. Now, we're not just talking about changing the main content, but also dynamically updating the sidebar navigation to highlight the current route and show relevant sub-items.

By the end of this code-along, you will be able to implement a dynamic sidebar navigation that:

- Highlights the current route
- Updates in real-time as users navigate
- Maintains a clean, organized structure
